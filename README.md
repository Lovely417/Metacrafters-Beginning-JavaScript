# Project: Create a NFT Collection

Welcome to my NFT project! This project brings together everything I've learned and adds some Merchandise that are my NFTs. In this project I will try to mint an NFT by writing some JavaScript code to create an object that represents my NFT and contains metadata. The metadata can be anything I want, Some examples of metadata are name, eye color, shirt type, jewelry, it can be animal, human any real object.The objects will hold various metadata  that makes each NFT unique. Write a function that will print the contents of my epic NFT to the console.
